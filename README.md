# Project:
## Title:
c01-horiseon-code-refactor-assignment

## Description:
As for our first week of homework for this assignment we (Columbia Engineering Bootcamp students) were given the following user story below and acceptance criteria:

### User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title.
```
The key focus on this project was accessibility, which involved cleaning up pre-existing html with semantic html and consolidating css. I (Casandra McDonald), achieved this by replacing the divs with semantic html such as header, nav, footer, aside, section, main, and figure. I added alt attributes on all of the images including an aria label for the background css image. I also, added a descriptive title, fixed all of the links, and corrected all header text h1-h4. The aria label for the background css is what makes this project stand out as we took the time to research accessibility and carefully consider every element. Even though I have been coding HTML for years, I always love learning new and proper ways to achieve code that is cleaner and to the highest standard. This was a great way to really learn and understand semantic HTML.

Thanks for reading!
